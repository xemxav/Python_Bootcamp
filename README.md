# Python_Bootcamp

On the course of 5 days we covered the different subjects offered by [42 AI](https://www.42ai.fr/). The aim of the bootcamp is to get a firm hand on Python and the different librairies for datascience (Panda and Numpy).

This week was a good refreshment for my pyhon skills aquired during my internship at RTE as a Django dev.
